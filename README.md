Grails-method-security-example
==============================

This is an example grails project to show some features of the Spring security Plugins (Core + ACL) for 
implementing method security in services. It's the source I used for writing the blog post [Getting Started with method security in Grails using Spring Security][1]
[1]: http://www.mscharhag.com/2013/10/getting-started-with-method-security-in.html


Relevant files are:
* `NoteService`, the service with secured methods

        grails-app/services/com/mscharhag/NoteService.groovy
		
* `NoteServiceTests`, test class for testing method security features
        
		test/integration/com/mscharhag/NoteServiceTests.groovy
		
* Bean configuration

        grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
	  
* Beans used for security constraint implementation

        src/groovy/com/mscharhag/GrailsBeanResolver.groovy
	    src/groovy/com/mscharhag/GrailsExpressionHandler.groovy
	    src/groovy/com/mscharhag/GrailsPermissionEvaluator.groovy
	    grails-app/services/com/mscharhag/SecurityService.groovy	   

* `Note` and `User`, two domain classes used by `NoteService`

        grails-app/domain/com/mscharhag/Note.groovy
		grails-app/domain/com/mscharhag/User.groovy
		
(The other files have been generated by Grails and haven't change)
